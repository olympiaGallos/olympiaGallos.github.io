## ðŸ”­ About Me
I am currently a PhD student at the [Institute of Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html), [UZH](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) and [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html) Zurich, Switzerland in the [Neuromorphic Cognitive Systems (NCS)](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/ncs.html) group. I started my PhD journey at the Neurosurgery Department of the University Hospital of Zurich, where I curated and analyzed intracranial EEG data from drug-resistant patients with focal epilepsy.
Previously, I earned my BSc and Integrated Master of Engineering (MEng) from the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.tuc.gr/en/home) department of the [Technical University of Crete (TUC)](https://www.tuc.gr/en/home).
